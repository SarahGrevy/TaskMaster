TaskMaster tool uses JavaScript to create several arrayed variables representing the frequency and duration with which participants enter and leave an active survey window. TaskMaster is designed to be accessible to researchers who are comfortable designing studies in Qualtrics, but who may have limited experience using programming languages like JavaScript. 

Researchers may treat TaskMaster output as a data quality measure or as a dependent variable. We advise researchers not to base participant payments/penalties on TaskMaster output without first informing participants that the TaskMaster is in use. 
 
As with any experimental study, researchers should seek explicit approval from their IRB or institutional ethics boards before implementing the TaskMaster.
